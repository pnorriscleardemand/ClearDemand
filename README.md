<h3>Project notes</h3>

<h5>General</h5>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://cleardemand.azurewebsites.net/" target="_blank">Demo Site</a>.</li>
    <li>The UI is showing the simple version of the markdown plan schedule. The backend supports any number of price reduction points. I didn't strictly follow the 
        first story, the system is allowing any mid-point date.
    </li>
    <li>I was time limited, so there are things I would do in a production app that were not done here. See below.</li>
    <li>Markdown plans can be found in the Products section.</li>
    <li>The app is on a trial plan, so it may be stopped and take a few seconds to warm up.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Things I would do if I had more time.</h5>
<ul>
    <li>The UI is very basic. I did not spend any time making it look nice.</li>
    <li>Unit tests.</li>
    <li>Logging and instrumentation. Logging is set up.</li>
    <li>Break down UI into more components for reuse.</li>
    <li>Add client and server validation. Stubbed for now.</li>
    <li>Authentication and authorization.</li>
    <li>Exception handling on server and messages in the UI.</li>
</ul>
